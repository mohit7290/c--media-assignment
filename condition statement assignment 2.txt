question 1
Predict the output:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main( ) {
int a = 5, b, c ;
b = a = 15 ;
c = a < 15 ;
cout << "a = " << a << ", b = " << b << " , c = "<< c ;
return 0;
}


ouput is => a=15  b=15  c=0
because the statement c=a<15 stores true and false in the varibale c


question 2
Predict the output:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
int x = 3 ;
float y = 3.0 ;
if (x == y)
cout <<"x and y are equal" ;
else
cout << "x and y are not equal" ;
return 0;
}


the output is x and y are equal 
beacause it has same value if y=3.1 then it will print x and y are not equal



question 4

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
int test = 0;
cout << "First character " << '1' << endl;
cout << "Second character " << (test ? 3 : '1') << endl;
return 0;
}


the output is First character =1
              Second character =1
beacause if conditioon true it will print 3 otherwise 1
0 is taken as false so it wil print 1 as second character




question 5

predict the output:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
int a = 18; int b = 12;
bool t = (a > 20 && b < 15)? true : false;
cout <<"Value of t: " << t ;
return 0;
}


the output is 0 
beacause in bool and operator is used it give true when both condition are true but a>20 is false
then it will give false so the output is 0



question 6

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
int number = -4;
char result;
result = number > 0 ? 'P' : 'N';
cout << result << endl;
return 0;
}



the output is N 
beacause condition is false
